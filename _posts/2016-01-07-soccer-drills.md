Soccer players have to be good on their feet, and that means building agility, speed and ball control. Soccer footwork drills are designed to develop all of these qualities. Among other skills, they can teach players how to move through defenders, how to quickly change direction without losing control of the ball and how to turn a great first touch into a sprint down the field and a goal.
